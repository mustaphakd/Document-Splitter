After installing and launching the app,

1) select the file that needs to be split

2) select the directory where the generated files need to be stored.

3) either type in the names of the files to be generated in the textbox  and then clicking on the "+" sign
	or create a text file with the names of the files to be generated each on its own line.

4)when everything is properly set, the ""Run "" button should be enable.  click it to have the tool generate the files.

5) when the tool is finished, the list of generated files should be provided at the bottom of the tool pane.
